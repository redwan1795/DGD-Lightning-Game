# Team Members:
Redwan Ul Haq Choyon, S B Ahmed Bony, Siva Boina, Alayna Montoya

# Pitch:
We've created a simple survival game with multiple objects to dodge. The final product would have more graphics for the space field and astronomical objects to avoid or fly over. Over time, the level would also increase in speed, making it harder for players to avoid obstacles.

# Goal:
1. Survival by dodging or flying/jumping over objects until the end
2. Hitting objects destroys your spaceship

# Commands:
1. Move left     : A/a or left arrow key
2. Move right    : D/d or right arrow key
3. Quit          : esc during the game
4. Button select : left mouse button
